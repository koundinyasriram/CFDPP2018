# CFDPP2018
This repository is for the submission made for Microsoft Code.Fun.Do++ 2018.

Our idea:-

We would like to build an application that would help the government agencies, NGO and other volunteering organizations to collaborate and associate each other with the resources available to them and that particular area to help out the disaster victims and ease out their grief and pain.

The main features we aim to build are as follows:
1) To maintain a log of availability of all the personnel such as doctors, psychologists, volunteers who could be of help.
2) To help catalog the necessary requirements and make corresponding arrangements for their availability
3) To arrange the safe rescuing acts of the victims and provide technological support for the same.
4) To be able to connect the victims to their family to avoid the common distress and comfort them socially.

Each organization can utilize this application for the handling the databases for each of their corresponding rescue and shelter camps and can connect themselves for mutual association.


We would be using python based GUI for the application and complement it with Microsoft Azure cloud services for the database and productive deployment of the same.
