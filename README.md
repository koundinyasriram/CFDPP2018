# CFDPP2018
This repository is for the submission made for Microsoft Code.Fun.Do++ 2018.

Our idea:-

We would like to build an application that would help the government agencies, NGOs and other volunteering organizations to collaborate and associate each other with the resources available to them in the disaster affected area to help the victims and ease out their grief and pain.

The main features we aim to build are as follows:
1) To maintain a log of availability of all the personnel such as doctors, psychologists, volunteers who could be of help.
	-- There could be several shelter camps of an organisation nearby a calamity affected region and there could be a limitation of personnel required. We can accomodate and schedule their availability accordingly by use of a smart automating ML based scheduler.
2) To help catalog the necessary requirements and make corresponding arrangements for their availability.
	--  We might be in the need of some urgent necessary equipments and medication not available with us right now which can be requested from the base camp and received in time.
3) To arrange the safe rescuing acts of the victims and provide technological support for the same.
	--  We could use advanced legal phone tracking services to discover the areas of presence of victims and plan on the corresponding rescue acts. (We may not be able to implement it as mentioned but we could provide the corresponding support for this feature).
4) To be able to connect the victims to their families to avoid common distress and comfort them socially during their sad times.
	-- We could use social networking information obtained from the families of possible victims to help locate and identify them and also to relay the information about their safety to their families.

Each organization can utilize this application for handling the databases for each of their corresponding rescue and shelter camps and connect them for mutual association.


We would be using python based GUI for the application and complement it with Microsoft Azure cloud services for the database and productive deployment of the same.
